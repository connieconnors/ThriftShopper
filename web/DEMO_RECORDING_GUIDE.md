## Recording Tips

### **Text Overlays/Annotations:**
- Use Clueso's text annotation feature
- Keep text brief (5-7 words max)
- Use brand colors: Navy (#191970) or Gold (#EFBF05)
- Position at top or bottom, not covering key UI elements
- Show for 2-3 seconds

### **Timing:**
- **Total length:** 3-4 minutes max
- **Pacing:** Don't rush, but keep it moving
- **Transitions:** Smooth, no jarring cuts

### **What to Highlight:**
1. ✅ **Ease of use** - Upload flow, AI assistance
2. ✅ **Discovery** - Mood filtering, browsing
3. ✅ **Personalization** - Canvas, favorites
4. ✅ **Seller tools** - Dashboard, stats
5. ✅ **Mobile-first** - Show on mobile viewport if possible

### **What to Avoid:**
- ❌ Don't show errors or loading states that take too long
- ❌ Don't show login/signup forms (too generic)
- ❌ Don't show settings details (too granular)
- ❌ Don't show actual payment processing (security concern)

### **Screen Size:**
- **Recommended:** Mobile viewport (375px width) or responsive view
- Shows mobile-first design
- More engaging for mobile users

### **Background Music (Optional):**
- If adding music, keep it subtle
- No voiceover needed (as requested)
- Let the UI speak for itself
